Maze Generator

This is a Java program that generates a random maze using Depth-First Search (DFS). The maze ensures a unique path between the start (S) and end (E) while also allowing some independent '.' paths that are not connected to S or E.

Features

Generates a random maze using DFS.

Ensures a single connected path between S and E.

Includes independent '.' paths that are not part of the main path.

Avoids direct extension of extra paths from S or E.

Works with odd-sized grids for optimal maze structures.
